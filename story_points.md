Story Points are a unit of measure for estimating the overall effort required to implement a user story or feature. They help teams gauge the complexity and workload involved in completing tasks. Below is a general guideline for interpreting Story Points in terms of effort and typical time required for one developer to complete the work.

| Story Points | Effort | Typical Time (1 Developer) | Notes                                          |
| ------------ | --------------- | -------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------- |
| **1**        | Very small      | 0.5 day (2–4 hours)        | Simple UI tweak, small config change           |
| **2**        | Small           | 1 day                      | Minor feature, small backend method            |
| **3**        | Moderate        | 1–2 days                   | New small component, simple API endpoint       |
| **5**        | Medium          | 2–3 days                   | Multi-step logic, some integration work        |
| **8**        | Large           | 4–5 days                   | Complex feature, multiple moving parts         |
| **13**       | Very large      | 1–1.5 weeks                | Multi-module work, heavy testing, coordination |
| **20+**      | Epic-sized      | 2+ weeks                   | Should be split into smaller stories           |
